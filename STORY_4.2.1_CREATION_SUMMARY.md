# Story 4.2.1: Tailor Group Order Coordination Interface - Creation Summary

**Created**: October 1, 2025  
**Created By**: Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Status**: Draft - Ready for Review and Prioritization

---

## üìã Story Overview

### Purpose
This story completes the deferred tailor-facing UI components from Story 4.2 (Group Order Management). While Story 4.2 delivered complete backend infrastructure and customer-facing features, the tailor coordination interface was intentionally deferred for future prioritization.

### User Story
**As a** tailor,  
**I want** a dedicated interface to coordinate and manage group orders,  
**so that** I can efficiently handle multiple garments with consistent design and quality.

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria (7)

1. **Group Order Dashboard** - Comprehensive view of all assigned group orders with priority indicators
2. **Fabric Allocation Calculator** - Total yardage calculations and per-item breakdown
3. **Production Schedule Planner** - Drag-and-drop priority scheduling with deadline management
4. **Design Suggestion Tool** - Coordinated outfit recommendations with cultural templates
5. **Bulk Progress Updates** - Update multiple items simultaneously with batch photo uploads
6. **Group Messaging Interface** - Communicate with all order participants efficiently
7. **Coordination Checklist** - Ensure design consistency and quality across all items
