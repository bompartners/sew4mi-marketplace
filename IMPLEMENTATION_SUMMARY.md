## What Was NOT Implemented (Non-Critical)

The following items were identified as "High Priority" or lower in the QA review but are not blockers for Done status:

- Real-time subscriptions (Supabase live updates)
- Complete notification service integration (structure in place)
- Form validation with Zod schemas
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback
- Offline capability with local caching
- Rate limiting middleware
- Audit logging

These can be addressed in future stories as enhancements.
