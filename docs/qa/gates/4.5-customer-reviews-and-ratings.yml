nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: READY
    notes: "Comprehensive security: Content sanitization (bad-words package), rate limiting (1 review per order), purchase verification, photo upload restrictions (5MB, JPEG/PNG/WebP only), CSRF protection. No concerns identified."
  performance:
    status: READY
    notes: "Clear performance benchmarks specified: Review list <500ms, submission <800ms, photo upload <3s on 3G, trigger execution <50ms, vote interaction <100ms optimistic. Database triggers for rating calculations prevent application-level bottlenecks."
  reliability:
    status: READY
    notes: "Business rules fully documented including edge cases (disputed orders, missing delivery confirmations, group orders, partial deliveries). 90-day review window with 48-hour edit policy clearly specified."
  maintainability:
    status: READY
    notes: "Clean architecture with repository/service/API/UI separation. All file paths specified. Moderation tools named (bad-words v3.0+). Notification templates provided. Storage service integration detailed."
  accessibility:
    status: READY
    notes: "Comprehensive accessibility requirements: Keyboard navigation specs, screen reader announcements, complete ARIA attributes, focus management, color contrast ratios, minimum touch targets (44x44px stars, 48x48px buttons)."
  testability:
    status: READY
    notes: "Test organization specified with unit/integration/E2E locations. Accessibility test requirements included. Mock patterns documented. All test scenarios identified."

validation_improvements:
  critical_fixes:
    - issue: "Incorrect architecture file reference (unified-project-structure.md)"
      resolution: "Corrected to source-tree.md"
      impact: "Dev agent can now locate correct architecture documentation"

  should_fix_additions:
    - issue: "Missing photo storage implementation details"
      resolution: "Added Photo Storage Configuration section with Supabase bucket setup, image transformation pipeline (3 variants), WebP compression, CDN caching, StorageService skeleton, and error handling"
      impact: "Dev agent has complete storage architecture specification"

    - issue: "Underspecified review eligibility logic"
      resolution: "Added Review Eligibility Business Rules section with time windows (24hr-90day), order status requirements, edit/delete policy (48hr text, 7day photos), and 4 edge case specifications"
      impact: "All business logic edge cases documented, no ambiguity"

    - issue: "Moderation workflow not detailed"
      resolution: "Specified bad-words npm package v3.0+ with Ghana-specific dictionary, spam detection rules (repeated text, excessive links, all-caps), auto-flagging thresholds (>3 profane words or >2 links)"
      impact: "Dev agent knows exact tools and thresholds to implement"

    - issue: "Missing database trigger detail for 4-category ratings"
      resolution: "Clarified overall rating = AVG(fit, quality, communication, timeliness) per review; tailor rating = AVG(overall) across approved reviews only; added category-specific averages (rating_fit_avg, etc.) to tailor_profiles"
      impact: "Database trigger logic completely specified, no guesswork"

  enhancements_added:
    - enhancement: "Notification template specifications"
      details: "Added email/WhatsApp templates for review requests, tailor notifications, customer responses, and admin alerts with example message formats"
      value: "Consistent notification UX, clear implementation guidance"

    - enhancement: "Accessibility test requirements"
      details: "Added keyboard navigation specs, screen reader announcements, ARIA attributes (role, aria-checked, aria-pressed, aria-required), focus management, color contrast, touch targets"
      value: "WCAG AA compliance, better user experience for assistive technology users"

    - enhancement: "Performance benchmarks"
      details: "Added 8 specific performance targets: review list 500ms, submission 800ms, photo upload 3s on 3G, trigger 50ms, moderation queue 200ms, page load 1.5s, vote 100ms optimistic, search 400ms"
      value: "Measurable acceptance criteria, clear optimization targets"

path_consistency:
  correction: "Removed sew4mi/ prefix from all file paths to match Story 4.4 pattern"
  rationale: "Story 4.4 Dev Notes states 'All paths are relative to monorepo root' but doesn't use prefix in file locations"
