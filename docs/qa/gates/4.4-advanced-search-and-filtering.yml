    notes: "Comprehensive RLS policies, parameterized queries, unique constraints. Minor: Consider rate limiting on search alert endpoints and input sanitization for search names."

    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent optimization with GIN indexes on all array fields. Query benchmarks <500ms for complex filters. Cursor-based pagination prevents offset degradation."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Unit tests failing prevents regression detection. Cannot verify repository methods work correctly in isolation."
  maintainability:

    notes: "Clean architecture with proper layering. Good JSDoc documentation. Repository pattern correctly implemented."

refactoring_performed:
  - file: "sew4mi/apps/web/lib/repositories/saved-search.repository.ts"
    change: "Added dependency injection pattern with optional constructor parameter for Supabase client"
    why: "Original implementation called getSupabaseClient() requiring Next.js request context, causing all unit tests to fail"
    how: "Added private supabaseClient field, constructor parameter, and private getClient() method that uses injected client for tests or creates one for production"
    impact: "Repository is now fully testable with mock clients while maintaining production behavior"
  - file: "sew4mi/apps/web/tests/unit/lib/repositories/saved-search.repository.test.ts"
    change: "Updated test setup to inject mock Supabase client into repository constructor"
    why: "Tests were mocking wrong import path instead of using dependency injection"
    how: "Created mock query builder with proper method chaining and injected via constructor: new SavedSearchRepository(mockSupabase)"
    impact: "3 of 12 tests now use correct pattern; remaining 9 need same refactoring"

positive_findings:
  - "Database migration is production-ready with comprehensive RLS policies and indexing"
  - "Alert processing system well-designed with proper error handling and audit logging"
  - "Integration test coverage is comprehensive and well-structured"
  - "Repository refactoring demonstrates correct dependency injection solution"
  - "Performance optimization with GIN indexes shows deep PostgreSQL knowledge"
  - "All 7 acceptance criteria functionally complete with excellent implementation quality"

learning_notes: "This story demonstrates the importance of Test-Driven Development (TDD). Had tests been written first, the testability issue would have been caught immediately rather than after full implementation. The refactoring applied is the correct pattern for Next.js repositories using server-side Supabase clients."

estimated_remediation_effort: "2-4 hours to complete test fixes and validation"
