        Three triggers execute on every review/vote operation:
        - trigger_update_tailor_ratings (on reviews INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
        - trigger_update_review_vote_counts (on votes INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
        - trigger_check_review_photos_limit (on photos INSERT)
        Potential performance bottleneck at scale.
      recommendation: |
        1. Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on trigger functions with realistic data
        2. Verify execution time < 100ms
        3. Consider async job queue if triggers slow (>100ms)
        4. Monitor trigger performance in staging/production
