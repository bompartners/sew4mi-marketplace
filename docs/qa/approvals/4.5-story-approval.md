## Validation Summary

### Validation Process

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Validator:** Sarah (Product Owner)
**Validation Type:** Pre-Implementation Story Review
**Validation Tool:** BMad Framework - validate-next-story task

### Issues Identified and Resolved

#### ✅ Critical Issues (1) - ALL RESOLVED

**CRITICAL #1: Incorrect Architecture File Reference**

   - Story 4.4 tests written after implementation
   - Story 4.5 includes comprehensive test specifications upfront
   - Dev agent encouraged to write tests first (TDD)

3. **Architecture Reference Accuracy**
   - Fixed incorrect file reference before implementation
   - All architecture references verified

4. **Business Rules Documentation**
   - Story 4.4 had some ambiguity in edge cases
   - Story 4.5 documents all edge cases explicitly
   - 90-day window, dispute handling, edit policies all specified
