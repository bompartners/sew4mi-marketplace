# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create a trust-building, mobile-first experience that feels as personal as visiting your neighborhood tailor while providing the reliability of modern e-commerce. The interface should celebrate Ghanaian cultural aesthetics while maintaining simplicity for users with varying digital literacy levels.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Start simple with core actions, reveal advanced features as users gain confidence
- **Visual Progress Tracking:** Photo-based journey from fabric to finished garment builds transparency and excitement
- **WhatsApp-Native Communication:** Leverage familiar messaging patterns for notifications and support
- **Family-Centric Design:** Easy switching between family member profiles with visual avatars
- **Offline-First Resilience:** Core functions work despite intermittent connectivity

## Core Screens and Views
- **Tailor Discovery Screen:** Browse expert tailors with portfolios, specializations, and ratings
- **Tailor Profile Page:** Portfolio gallery, customer reviews, specializations, availability calendar
- **Order Creation Flow:** Step-by-step garment specification, measurement input, timeline selection
- **Family Measurement Hub:** Visual family tree with measurement profiles and update reminders
- **Order Progress Dashboard:** Timeline view with milestone photos, payment status, messages
- **Payment Confirmation Screens:** Clear escrow explanation at each payment milestone
- **Dispute Resolution Interface:** Document upload, messaging thread, resolution timeline

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The platform will meet WCAG AA standards to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities, including proper color contrast, screen reader support, and keyboard navigation.

## Branding
Modern African aesthetic combining traditional Kente patterns as subtle design elements with clean, professional typography. Color palette should evoke trust (blue), craftsmanship (gold accents), and Ghana heritage (red/green/yellow used sparingly). Photography should showcase real Ghanaian professionals in authentic work and social settings.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Mobile-first responsive web application optimized for smartphones (85% of users), with functional desktop experience for admin users and corporate partnerships. Progressive Web App architecture enables app-like experience without app store friction.
