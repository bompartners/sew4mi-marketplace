## Background Context

Ghana's tailoring heritage represents centuries of exceptional craftsmanship, yet 70% of custom clothing orders currently fail due to late delivery, poor fit, or payment disputes. This represents ₵500M in annual value destruction and prevents customers from accessing the superior fit and cultural authenticity that custom clothing provides.

The Sew4Mi marketplace addresses this challenge by building trust-first infrastructure that preserves the personal relationships and cultural expertise of traditional tailoring while adding payment protection, reliable delivery dates, and quality verification. Our progressive escrow system (25%-50%-25% payments), expert tailor verification process, and delivery reliability system transform custom clothing into a dependable service for emerging professionals building career wardrobes.

Enhanced with deep WhatsApp integration, Sew4Mi makes trusted custom tailoring accessible through Ghana's most familiar communication platform, enabling voice-based measurements in local languages, family coordination for group orders, and conversational order creation while maintaining all quality and payment protection standards.
