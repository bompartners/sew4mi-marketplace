- Extend existing OrderCreationWizard patterns with group order context
- Use Shadcn/ui components for consistent styling with Ghana theme colors
- Implement real-time updates with Supabase subscriptions for group progress tracking
- Use Zustand for group order state management with progress tracking

**State Management** (aligned with existing state architecture):
```typescript
interface GroupOrderState {
  activeGroupOrders: EnhancedGroupOrder[];
  currentGroupOrderId: string | null;
  selectedFamilyProfiles: string[];
  groupOrderProgress: { [groupOrderId: string]: GroupProgressSummary };
  actions: {
    createGroupOrder: (orderData: CreateGroupOrderInput) => Promise<EnhancedGroupOrder>;
    updateGroupOrder: (id: string, updates: Partial<EnhancedGroupOrder>) => void;
    addItemToGroup: (groupOrderId: string, itemData: GroupOrderItemInput) => void;
    updateGroupProgress: (groupOrderId: string, progress: GroupProgressSummary) => void;
    processGroupPayment: (groupOrderId: string, paymentData: GroupPaymentInput) => void;
  };
}
```

**Ghana Cultural Integration**:
- Support for traditional event types (weddings, funerals, naming ceremonies, festivals)
- Integration with local fabric vendors and traditional garment types
- Family hierarchy considerations for group order organization and payment responsibility
- Traditional color coordination for cultural events

### Core Workflow Integration

**Group Order Creation Workflow** (based on core-workflows.md patterns):
The group order system integrates with the established Family Group Order Coordination workflow:
1. Customer creates group order with event details and family member selection
2. System applies bulk discount calculations for 3+ items
3. Customer selects fabric coordination and payment options
4. Individual orders are created and linked to group order
5. Payment processing handles single payer or split payment scenarios
6. Progress tracking aggregates individual order milestones
7. Staggered delivery allows completed items to be delivered early

**Group Progress Tracking Workflow**:
1. Individual order milestones update group progress aggregation
2. Notification service sends updates to all group members
3. Customer dashboard shows overall group progress and individual statuses
4. Completed items trigger staggered delivery notifications
5. Group completion triggers final payment release and review requests

### Mobile-First Design Considerations

**Ghana Mobile Optimization** (aligned with tech stack requirements):
- Touch-friendly group order creation with swipe navigation between family members
- Progressive loading for group order dashboards with multiple items
- Offline viewing of cached group progress and payment status
- Network-aware bulk discount calculations and progress updates
- Clear visual indicators for individual vs. group progress

**Connectivity Optimization**:
- Cache group order data locally for offline viewing
- Queue group order actions for sync when connectivity returns
- Compress progress photos and updates for efficient transmission
- Show clear indicators for outdated vs. current group progress data

**Ghana Cultural Considerations**:
- Support for traditional event types (weddings, funerals, outdooring ceremonies)
- Respect for family hierarchy in group payment responsibility
- Traditional fabric coordination for cultural events
- Event-based group order templates for common celebrations

## QA Results

### Review Date: October 1, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation Quality: Good** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆

The group order management implementation demonstrates solid architecture with comprehensive type definitions, validation schemas, and business logic separation. The developer has created 57 passing unit tests and implemented all 7 acceptance criteria with well-structured components and services. However, there are critical architectural violations and missing integration tests that need to be addressed before marking this story as complete.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Excellent type safety with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and JSDoc documentation
- ✅ Strong validation using Zod schemas with proper business rules
- ✅ Well-designed database schema with appropriate indexes, constraints, and triggers
- ✅ Good component architecture with proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Cultural integration for Ghana market (event types, coordination suggestions)
- ✅ Bulk discount tier logic correctly implemented with helper functions
- ✅ 57 unit tests passing for types and business logic

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ **Repository Pattern Violation**: `GroupOrderService` calls `supabaseServer()` directly in 6 places, violating coding standard requiring repository layer
- ❌ **Missing Integration Tests**: No integration tests found despite completion notes claiming they exist
- ❌ **Missing E2E Tests**: Story testing requirements mention E2E tests but none implemented
- ❌ **Incomplete API Coverage**: Missing API routes for items, payments, and delivery management
- ❌ **No Error Handler Middleware**: API routes don't use standard error handler as required by coding standards

### Refactoring Performed

#### **File**: `apps/web/lib/repositories/groupOrderRepository.ts` (CREATED)
- **Change**: Created new repository class following existing repository pattern
- **Why**: Coding standards mandate repository pattern for all database access
- **How**: Extends base `Repository<GroupOrder>` class, abstracts all Supabase calls, provides type-safe database operations

#### **File**: `apps/web/lib/services/group-order.service.ts` (REFACTORED)
- **Change**: Refactored to use `GroupOrderRepository` instead of direct `supabaseServer()` calls
- **Why**: Violated critical coding standard: "Repository pattern only - never call Supabase client directly"
- **How**: Injected repository dependency, replaced all direct Supabase operations with repository methods, improved error handling and separation of concerns

#### **File**: `apps/web/lib/services/group-order.service.ts` (ENHANCED JSDOC)
- **Change**: Enhanced JSDoc comments for all public methods with comprehensive examples
- **Why**: Coding standards require examples in JSDoc for all public APIs
- **How**: Added @example blocks with realistic usage scenarios for createGroupOrder, calculateBulkDiscount, and other public methods

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** 
  - ❌ Repository pattern violated (now fixed)
  - ❌ Error handler middleware not used in API routes
  - ✅ Type sharing correctly implemented in `packages/shared/src/types`
  - ✅ Naming conventions followed (PascalCase components, camelCase services, snake_case DB)
  - ⚠️ JSDoc comments present but lacking examples (now enhanced)
  
- **Project Structure**: ✅ **PASS**
  - ✅ Files correctly placed in unified project structure
  - ✅ Components in `apps/web/components/features/orders/`
  - ✅ Types in `packages/shared/src/types/`
  - ✅ Schemas in `packages/shared/src/schemas/`
  - ✅ API routes in `apps/web/app/api/orders/group/`
  
- **Testing Strategy**: ❌ **FAIL**
  - ✅ 57 unit tests for types and constants (excellent coverage)
  - ❌ No integration tests found (required by testing strategy)
  - ❌ No E2E tests found (mentioned in story but not implemented)
  - ❌ Coverage target unclear - need to verify 60% statement coverage
  - ❌ Missing tests for GroupOrderService methods
  - ❌ Missing tests for API routes
  
- **All ACs Met**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL**
  - ✅ AC1: Group order creation with multiple garments ✓
  - ✅ AC2: Fabric coordination across items ✓
  - ✅ AC3: Bulk discount calculation (3+ items) ✓
  - ✅ AC4: Individual progress tracking ✓
  - ⚠️ AC5: Staggered delivery (component exists but API incomplete)
  - ⚠️ AC6: Payment options (component exists but API incomplete)
  - ⚠️ AC7: Tailor coordination (backend infrastructure only, UI deferred)

### Security Review

**✅ Database Security: EXCELLENT**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies properly implemented in migration
- Proper foreign key constraints with CASCADE deletes
- Input validation at database level with CHECK constraints
- Secure UUID generation for all IDs
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities detected

**✅ Input Validation: STRONG**
- Comprehensive Zod schemas validate all user inputs
- Business rule validation (min participants, advance days, etc.)
- UUID format validation for all references
- Amount validation (positive values, no negatives)

**⚠️ API Security: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**
- ✅ Authentication checks present in API routes
- ❌ No rate limiting visible for bulk operations
- ❌ Missing CSRF protection (should be handled by Next.js middleware)
- ⚠️ Error messages may leak implementation details

**Recommendations:**
- Add rate limiting for group order creation (prevent abuse)
- Sanitize error messages in production to avoid leaking stack traces
- Consider adding request size limits for large group orders

### Performance Considerations

**✅ Database Performance: GOOD**
- Proper indexes on all foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Generated columns for computed values (outstanding_amount)
- Efficient array operations for order items

**⚠️ Query Optimization: NEEDS ATTENTION**
- `getGroupOrderSummary()` makes 4 separate database queries (N+1 problem)
- Should use joins or PostgreSQL JSON aggregation for single query
- `updateGroupOrderProgress()` could be optimized with database function

**✅ Frontend Performance: GOOD**
- Components use React best practices (useState, useEffect)
- Proper loading states and error handling
- Bulk discount calculation memoized appropriately

**Recommendations:**
- Refactor `getGroupOrderSummary()` to use single query with joins
- Consider caching bulk discount calculations for repeated requests
- Implement pagination for large group orders list

### Architecture & Design Patterns

**✅ Patterns Used Well:**
- Service layer pattern for business logic
- Repository pattern (after refactoring) for data access
- Validation at multiple layers (client, server, database)
- Separation of concerns (components, services, repositories)

**⚠️ Pattern Improvements Needed:**
- Error handling could use Result/Either pattern for better type safety
- Consider implementing CQRS pattern for complex group order queries
- State management might benefit from Zustand store for group orders
