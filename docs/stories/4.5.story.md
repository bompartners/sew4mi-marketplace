## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.4 (Advanced Search and Filtering):
- Database migrations are applied using Supabase CLI
- GIN indexes used for JSONB fields for performance
- Background jobs configured using pg_cron for scheduled tasks
- Notification system already in place for saved search alerts
- Frontend uses collapsible UI sections for better mobile experience
[Source: Previous story 4.4 completion notes]

### Data Models
**Review Table Structure** (extending existing schema):
```sql
-- From database-schema.md, reviews table already exists with basic structure:
-- id, order_id, reviewer_id, tailor_id, rating, comment, photos[], created_at
-- Need to extend with:
-- rating_fit, rating_quality, rating_communication, rating_timeliness (all INTEGER 1-5)
-- moderation_status (ENUM: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, FLAGGED)
-- is_verified_purchase (BOOLEAN - computed from order)
-- helpful_count, unhelpful_count (INTEGER)
```
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#reviews]

**Relationships:**
- Review belongs to Order (one-to-one)
- Review belongs to User (reviewer)
- Review belongs to TailorProfile
- Review has many ReviewPhotos
- Review has many ReviewVotes
- Review has one ReviewResponse (optional)
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#relationships]

### API Specifications
**REST Endpoints Pattern:**
- All API routes follow kebab-case: `/api/reviews/create`
- Use Zod for input validation
- Standard error handler middleware required
- JWT validation in middleware only
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

**Edge Function Configuration:**
```typescript
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
  regions: ['iad1'], // US East - closest to Europe/Africa
};
```
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#function-template]

### Component Specifications
**Component Organization:**
- Review components go in `components/features/reviews/`
- Use Shadcn/ui base components (Card, Badge, Button, Dialog)
- Implement with TypeScript and proper type imports from `@sew4mi/shared/types`
- Follow memo pattern for performance
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]

**State Management:**
- Use React Query for server state (reviews data)
- Zustand for client state if needed
- Implement optimistic updates for voting
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-patterns]

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- **Types:** `packages/shared/src/types/review.ts`
- **Repository:** `apps/web/lib/repositories/review.repository.ts`
- **Service:** `apps/web/lib/services/review.service.ts`
- **API Routes:** `apps/web/app/api/reviews/`
- **Components:** `apps/web/components/features/reviews/`
- **Tests:** `apps/web/tests/unit/` and `apps/web/tests/integration/`
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Photo Storage Configuration
**Supabase Storage Setup:**
```typescript
// Bucket configuration for review photos
const REVIEW_PHOTOS_BUCKET = 'review-photos';

// Storage policies (to be added to Supabase Storage)
// - Public read access for approved reviews
// - Authenticated write access for customers with verified orders
// - File size limit: 5MB per upload
// - Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp
```

**Image Processing Pipeline:**
- **Original Upload:** Store original with filename pattern: `{orderId}/{reviewId}/{timestamp}-{random}.jpg`
- **Transformations:** Create 3 variants on upload:
  - Thumbnail: 150x150px (for review cards)
  - Medium: 600x600px (for lightbox preview)
  - Optimized: Max 1200px width (for full-size viewing)
- **Compression:** Use WebP format with 80% quality for bandwidth optimization
- **CDN Caching:** Set Cache-Control header to `public, max-age=31536000` (1 year)

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
// apps/web/lib/services/storage.service.ts
export class StorageService {
  async uploadReviewPhoto(
    file: File,
    orderId: string,
    reviewId: string
  ): Promise<ReviewPhotoUpload> {
    // 1. Validate file (size, type, dimensions)
    // 2. Generate unique filename
    // 3. Upload to Supabase Storage
    // 4. Trigger image transformation function
    // 5. Return photo URLs (original, thumbnail, medium, optimized)
  }
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- Upload timeout: 30 seconds (retry once on failure)
- Invalid file type: Return user-friendly error message
- Size exceeded: Compress client-side before upload if >5MB
- Network failure: Queue upload for retry when online
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Code-Duplication-Prevention-Rules]

### Review Eligibility Business Rules
**Eligibility Criteria:**
1. **Time Window:**
   - Review prompt appears 24 hours after `actual_delivery` timestamp
   - Customer can submit review up to 90 days after delivery
   - After 90 days, review submission is disabled

2. **Order Status Requirements:**
   - Order must have status `DELIVERED` (not `DISPUTED`, `CANCELLED`, or `REFUNDED`)
   - If order is disputed after review submission, review is hidden (not deleted)
   - Resolved disputes (in customer's favor) keep review visible
   - Resolved disputes (in tailor's favor) mark review as `DISPUTED_RESOLVED`

3. **Edit and Delete Policy:**
   - Customers can edit review text and ratings within 48 hours of submission
   - Photo additions allowed within 7 days (up to 5 photos total)
   - Reviews cannot be deleted, only hidden by customer (remains in database)
   - Admin can moderate/remove inappropriate content at any time

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Missing delivery confirmation:** If order status is `READY_FOR_DELIVERY` for >14 days, auto-mark as delivered
   - **Group orders:** Each item in group order can be reviewed separately
   - **Partial deliveries:** Review enabled per delivered item, not entire order
   - **Reorders:** Each order gets separate review (no "duplicate review" restriction)

**Eligibility Check Implementation:**
```typescript
interface ReviewEligibility {
  canReview: boolean;
  reason?: 'NOT_DELIVERED' | 'DISPUTED' | 'CANCELLED' | 'ALREADY_REVIEWED' | 'TIME_EXPIRED';
  daysRemaining?: number;
  existingReview?: Review;
}

// Repository method: checkReviewEligibility(orderId: string): Promise<ReviewEligibility>
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#relationships]

### Testing Requirements
**Test Organization:**
- Unit tests in `apps/web/tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `apps/web/tests/integration/`
- Use Vitest for all tests
- Follow existing test patterns from architecture
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

**Test Coverage Required:**
- All public functions must have tests
- Repository methods: test database operations
- Service methods: test business logic with mocked dependencies
- API endpoints: test auth, validation, and responses
- Components: test rendering, user interactions, and state changes
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]

### Technical Constraints
**Performance:**
- Reviews list must use pagination (limit 10 per page)
- Implement lazy loading for review photos
- Cache tailor ratings using Vercel KV (5-minute TTL, invalidate on new review)
- Use database triggers for rating calculations (not application-level)

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Review list load time: <500ms for 10 reviews (p95)
- Single review submission: <800ms end-to-end (including DB trigger execution)
- Photo upload time: <3s on 3G network (with client-side compression)
- Rating calculation trigger: <50ms execution time
- Moderation queue query: <200ms for fetching 50 pending reviews
- Tailor profile with reviews: <1.5s total page load on 3G
- Vote interaction (helpful/unhelpful): <100ms optimistic UI update, <300ms server confirmation
- Review search/filter: <400ms for text search across 1000+ reviews
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#performance-optimization]

**Security:**
- Sanitize all review content before storage
- Implement rate limiting on review submission (1 per order)
- Verify purchase before allowing review
- Photo uploads limited to 5MB, JPEG/PNG only
- CSRF protection on all POST endpoints
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#security-requirements]

**Mobile Optimization:**
- Touch-friendly star rating component
- Compressed images for 3G networks
- Progressive enhancement for offline viewing
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
