### Core Workflow Integration

**Order Progress Tracking Workflow** (based on core-workflows.md patterns):
The order progress tracking integrates with the established milestone progression workflow:
1. Tailor uploads milestone photos (from existing milestone workflow)
2. System updates order status and calculates progress percentage
3. Real-time notifications sent to customer via PWA and WhatsApp
4. Customer views progress timeline with photos and estimated completion
5. In-app messaging enables clarifications without leaving the application
6. Order history maintains complete audit trail of all status changes

**Real-time Update Flow**:
1. Milestone update triggers Supabase real-time event
2. Frontend receives update via subscription hook
3. Progress percentage recalculated and UI updated
4. Push notification sent if user has opted in
5. Order timeline refreshes with new milestone data

### Mobile-First Design Considerations

**Ghana Mobile Optimization** (aligned with tech stack requirements):
- Touch-friendly milestone timeline navigation
- Swipe gestures for photo gallery browsing
- Offline viewing of cached milestone photos
- Progressive loading for timeline data
- Network-aware notification delivery

**Connectivity Optimization**:
- Cache milestone photos locally for offline viewing
- Queue messages for sending when connectivity returns
- Compress notification payloads for faster delivery
- Show clear indicators for cached vs. live data

**Ghana Cultural Considerations**:
- Support for multiple notification languages (EN, TWI, GA)
- Integration with WhatsApp notification patterns
- Respect for local communication preferences
- Event-based milestone terminology (wedding preparations, etc.)

### Testing
