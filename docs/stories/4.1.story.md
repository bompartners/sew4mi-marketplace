### Component Architecture Integration

**Family Profile Components** (following established frontend architecture patterns):
- Extend existing MeasurementForm patterns with family member context
- Use Shadcn/ui components for consistent styling with Ghana theme colors
- Implement real-time updates with Supabase subscriptions for family sharing
- Use Zustand for family profile state management with persistence

**State Management** (aligned with existing state architecture):
```typescript
interface FamilyState {
  familyProfiles: FamilyMeasurementProfile[];
  selectedProfileId: string | null;
  activeFamily: FamilyAccount | null;
  actions: {
    addFamilyMember: (profile: FamilyMeasurementProfile) => void;
    updateProfile: (id: string, updates: Partial<FamilyMeasurementProfile>) => void;
    selectProfile: (id: string) => void;
    scheduleReminder: (profileId: string, frequency: ReminderFrequency) => void;
  };
}
```

**Ghana Cultural Integration**:
- Support for local relationship terms (Daddy, Mummy, Big Brother, Little Sister)
- Integration with existing WhatsApp notification patterns for reminders
- Family hierarchy respect in profile sharing and permissions
- Traditional garment sizing patterns for family events

### Core Workflow Integration

**Family Profile Management Workflow** (based on core-workflows.md patterns):
The family profile system integrates with the established order creation workflow:
1. Customer creates family member profiles with nicknames and measurements
2. During order creation, customer selects appropriate family member profile
3. System validates measurement currency and suggests updates for children
4. Order creation proceeds with selected family member's measurements
5. Automated reminders scheduled based on age and growth patterns

**Growth Reminder Workflow**:
1. System calculates next reminder date based on birth date and frequency settings
2. Notification service sends reminders via preferred channels (SMS, WhatsApp, email)
3. Customer updates measurements and photos for growing family members
4. System tracks measurement changes over time for growth analysis
5. Updated profiles available for future order creation

### Mobile-First Design Considerations

**Ghana Mobile Optimization** (aligned with tech stack requirements):
- Touch-friendly family member selection with avatar thumbnails
- Swipe gestures for navigating between family profiles
- Offline viewing of cached family profiles and measurements
- Progressive loading for avatar images and profile data
- Network-aware reminder scheduling and delivery

**Connectivity Optimization**:
- Cache family profiles locally for offline access during order creation
- Compress avatar images for faster upload and display
- Queue reminder notifications for delivery when connectivity returns
- Show clear indicators for outdated vs. current measurement data

**Ghana Cultural Considerations**:
- Support for extended family structures (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins)
- Respect for family hierarchy in profile sharing permissions
- Traditional age-based sizing for children's garments
- Cultural event-based measurement tracking (school uniforms, church clothes, etc.)

### Testing

**Testing Requirements** (based on testing-strategy.md):

**Test File Locations**:
- Unit tests: `sew4mi/apps/web/tests/unit/components/features/measurements/`

- Use React Testing Library for component tests with accessibility validation
- Mock Supabase real-time subscriptions and notification services in tests
- Test family profile creation, editing, and sharing workflows
- Integration tests must cover complete family profile lifecycle

- Integration with existing order creation and measurement systems
- Error handling for profile validation and sharing conflicts

### Privacy and Security Integration

**Data Privacy** (following established security patterns):
- Family profile data encrypted at rest in Supabase Storage
- Profile sharing uses secure tokens with expiration
- Family member avatars stored with appropriate access controls
- Audit trail for all profile access and modification
- GDPR-compliant data deletion for archived profiles

**Permission System** (aligned with existing auth architecture):
