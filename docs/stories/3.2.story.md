  location: { lat: number; lng: number }; // PostGIS for spatial queries
  city: string; // Indexed for location filtering
  verificationStatus: 'PENDING' | 'VERIFIED' | 'SUSPENDED';
  portfolioImages: string[];
  capacity: number;
  averageDeliveryDays: number;
  averageResponseHours: number; // For response time sorting
  rating: number; // For rating sorting
  totalOrders: number;
  completedOrders: number;

  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**New CustomerFavorite Model**:
```typescript
interface CustomerFavorite {
  id: string;
  customerId: string;
  tailorId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

**Search Request/Response Models**:

- Add Redis caching on backend for frequent search queries

### Google Maps Integration

**Google Maps API Integration** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#google-maps-api]:
- Use existing Google Maps patterns from location services
- Implement marker clustering for dense tailor locations
- Include distance calculation in search results

**Location Services**:
- Request user location permission for distance-based search
- Implement graceful fallback to IP-based location detection
- Cache geocoding results to minimize API usage
- Use PostGIS spatial queries for efficient distance calculations

### Search Algorithm Implementation

**Full-Text Search** [Source: architecture/components.md#search-discovery-engine]:
- PostgreSQL full-text search on business names and specializations
- Implement search result ranking based on multiple factors:
  - Text relevance score
  - Tailor rating weight
  - Response time factor
  - Availability status
- Use trigram matching for fuzzy search capabilities

**Filtering and Sorting Logic**:
- Location filtering using PostGIS spatial queries within radius
- Price range filtering using garment_pricing table data
- Specialization filtering using array overlap queries
- Sort by rating (weighted by review count), response time, distance
- Implement featured tailor boost in search results

### Mobile-First Design Considerations

**Ghana Mobile Optimization** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Touch-friendly search interface optimized for mobile screens
- Progressive enhancement: basic search works without JavaScript
- Offline capability for recent search results caching
- Map view optimized for mobile data usage (compressed markers)
- Location-based search prioritized for local tailor discovery

**Bandwidth Optimization**:
- Lazy loading of tailor portfolio images in search results
- Pagination optimized for mobile (10-15 results per page)
- Compressed search result data (essential fields only)
- Progressive image loading with low-resolution placeholders

### Featured Tailors Algorithm

**Selection Criteria**:
- High rating (4.5+ stars) with minimum 10 reviews
- Fast response time (< 2 hours average)
- High completion rate (95%+ orders completed on time)
- Active profile (accepted orders in last 30 days)
- Diverse specializations for variety

**Business Logic**:
- Automatic rotation based on performance metrics
- Manual admin override for promotional campaigns
- Geographic distribution to cover major cities
- New tailor spotlight for diversity and growth

### Analytics and Optimization

**Search Analytics Tracking**:
- Track search queries and result click-through rates
- Monitor search performance metrics (response time, result relevance)
- A/B testing framework for search result ranking algorithms
- Conversion tracking from search to order creation

**Performance Monitoring**:
- Search response time alerts (> 500ms)
- Cache hit/miss ratios for optimization
