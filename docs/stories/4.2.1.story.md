interface TailorGroupOrderState {
  assignedGroupOrders: EnhancedGroupOrder[];
  activeCoordination: TailorGroupCoordination | null;
  fabricAllocations: { [groupOrderId: string]: FabricAllocation[] };
  productionSchedule: ProductionSchedule[];
  designSuggestions: { [groupOrderId: string]: DesignSuggestion[] };
  actions: {
    loadAssignedGroupOrders: () => Promise<void>;
    updateFabricAllocation: (groupOrderId: string, allocation: FabricAllocation) => void;
    updateProductionSchedule: (schedule: ProductionSchedule) => void;
    submitDesignSuggestion: (groupOrderId: string, suggestion: DesignSuggestion) => void;
    bulkUpdateProgress: (itemIds: string[], progressData: ProgressUpdate) => void;
    sendGroupMessage: (groupOrderId: string, message: Message) => void;
  };
}
```

**Ghana Cultural Integration**:
- Design suggestion templates for traditional events (weddings, funerals, naming ceremonies, festivals)
- Cultural color coordination guidelines (appropriate colors for different events)
- Traditional garment coordination patterns (matching Kente patterns, etc.)
- Respect for cultural significance in design recommendations

**Tailor Workflow Optimization**:
- Quick access to most urgent group orders (event date approaching)
- Batch operations to minimize repetitive tasks
- Template-based design suggestions to speed coordination
- Voice notes support for coordination messages (WhatsApp integration)

### WhatsApp Integration Patterns

**WhatsApp Service Integration** (from existing implementation):
- Use `whatsapp-integration.service.ts` for all WhatsApp operations
- Integration via Twilio WhatsApp Business API
- Message templates in `WHATSAPP_TEMPLATES` constants

**Key WhatsApp Operations**:
```typescript
// Send group coordination message
await whatsAppService.sendMessage({
  to: customerPhone,
  templateType: WhatsAppTemplateType.CUSTOM,
  message: coordinationMessage,
  mediaUrl: [progressPhotoUrl]
});
```

**Message Templates for Group Order Coordination**:
- Design approval requests with reference images
- Fabric selection confirmations
- Progress updates with photos
- Completion notifications

**Webhook Handling**:
- Webhook endpoint: `/api/webhooks/twilio/whatsapp/route.ts`
- Message status tracking (sent, delivered, read, failed)
- Signature verification for security
- Support for interactive button responses

**Integration Points**:
- `GroupOrderMessaging` component uses `whatsAppService.sendMessage()`
- Notification service handles WhatsApp delivery for bulk updates
- Media upload for progress photos via WhatsApp
- Fallback to SMS if WhatsApp unavailable

**Rate Limiting & Error Handling**:
- Respect Twilio rate limits for bulk messaging
- Queue messages for staggered delivery to avoid spam detection
- Graceful fallback to notification system if WhatsApp fails
- User-friendly error messages for Ghana context

### Cultural Event Template Structure

**Template Data Model**:
```typescript
interface CulturalEventTemplate {
  id: string;
  eventType: 'wedding' | 'funeral' | 'naming_ceremony' | 'festival' | 'church' | 'graduation';
  displayName: string;
  culturalContext: string;
  recommendedColors: ColorPalette;
  traditionalPatterns?: string[];
  modernAlternatives?: string[];
  coordinationGuidelines: string;
  fabricSuggestions: string[];
}

interface ColorPalette {
  primary: string[];      // Main outfit colors
  accent: string[];       // Complementary colors
  avoid: string[];        // Culturally inappropriate colors
  significance: string;   // Cultural meaning
}
```

**Sample Cultural Event Templates**:

**1. Traditional Wedding Template**:
```typescript
{
  eventType: 'wedding',
  displayName: 'Traditional Ghanaian Wedding',
  culturalContext: 'Coordinated Kente or matching prints for family',
  recommendedColors: {
    primary: ['Gold', 'Royal Blue', 'Burgundy', 'Emerald Green'],
    accent: ['White', 'Cream', 'Silver'],
    avoid: ['Black', 'Red'],
    significance: 'Bright colors symbolize joy and celebration'
  },
  traditionalPatterns: ['Kente weave', 'Adinkra symbols', 'Batik prints'],
  coordinationGuidelines: 'Family members should wear complementary colors from same fabric lot. Bride/groom colors should be distinctive but harmonious.',
  fabricSuggestions: ['Kente cloth', 'Woodin prints', 'Premium wax prints']
}
```

**2. Funeral/Memorial Template**:
```typescript
{
  eventType: 'funeral',
  displayName: 'Funeral/Memorial Service',
  culturalContext: 'Respectful coordinated mourning attire',
  recommendedColors: {
    primary: ['Black', 'Deep Red', 'Brown', 'Dark Purple'],
    accent: ['White (for elders)', 'Black and White'],
    avoid: ['Bright colors', 'Yellow', 'Pink'],
    significance: 'Somber colors show respect for the deceased'
  },
  coordinationGuidelines: 'All family members in matching black/red fabrics. White reserved for immediate family or elders depending on tradition.',
  fabricSuggestions: ['Black cotton', 'Red and black prints', 'Traditional mourning cloth']
}
```

**3. Naming Ceremony Template**:
```typescript
{
  eventType: 'naming_ceremony',
  displayName: 'Naming Ceremony (Outdooring)',
  culturalContext: 'Celebration of new life, coordinated family outfits',
  recommendedColors: {
    primary: ['White', 'Light Blue', 'Pink', 'Cream', 'Gold'],
    accent: ['Silver', 'Baby Blue', 'Soft Pink'],
    avoid: ['Black', 'Dark colors'],
    significance: 'Light, cheerful colors represent new beginnings'
  },
  coordinationGuidelines: 'Parents in white or cream, family in coordinating pastels. Baby in special ceremonial cloth.',
  fabricSuggestions: ['White lace', 'Soft cotton prints', 'Embroidered fabrics']
}

```

**Template Usage in Design Suggestion Tool**:
- Templates loaded in `DesignSuggestionTool` component
- Tailor selects event type, template auto-populates suggestions
- Color palette picker constrained to culturally appropriate colors
- Guidelines displayed to help tailor make coordinated recommendations
- Customer approval workflow with template reference

**Storage**:
- Templates stored in `design_suggestions` table with `cultural_theme` field
- Reference images for each template type in Supabase Storage
- Template library expandable for regional variations

### Testing

## QA Results

### Review Date: October 1, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation Quality: Good with Required Improvements**

The implementation demonstrates solid React/TypeScript fundamentals with well-structured components following modern best practices. The code is generally clean, maintainable, and properly typed. However, several critical features are only partially implemented with placeholder code, and the test coverage falls significantly short of requirements.

**Strengths:**
- **Component Architecture**: All 7 core components are well-designed with clear separation of concerns, proper prop interfaces, and TypeScript typing
- **Mobile-First Design**: Components include responsive layouts with mobile optimization considerations
- **Cultural Integration**: Ghana cultural event templates are comprehensive and well-implemented in the Design Suggestion Tool
- **Error Handling**: Loading and error states are consistently implemented across components
- **Code Documentation**: JSDoc comments provide clear component descriptions and prop documentation
- **UI/UX**: Shadcn/ui components used consistently with good visual hierarchy and user feedback

**Weaknesses:**
- **Incomplete Implementations**: Critical features like WhatsApp integration, image uploads, and real-time subscriptions are placeholder code
- **Test Coverage**: Only 1 test file exists when story requires comprehensive testing for all 7 components
- **Missing Backend Services**: Dev Notes specify services and repositories that are absent from implementation
- **Hard-coded Values**: Some components contain hard-coded estimations (e.g., 3 days per garment) instead of configurable values

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring was performed during this review.** The following critical issues require developer attention before refactoring can be justified:

1. **Incomplete Feature Implementation** - Core functionality must be completed first
2. **Missing Test Coverage** - Cannot safely refactor without comprehensive tests
3. **Placeholder Code** - WhatsApp integration, image uploads, and notification services need implementation

### Compliance Check

### Test Coverage Review

**Current State: Severely Inadequate**

Only 1 test file exists (`TailorGroupOrderDashboard.test.tsx`) when comprehensive testing was required.

**Existing Test Quality:**
- Dashboard test file has good coverage of the component it tests
- Tests include loading states, error states, filtering, sorting, and user interactions
- Mock data is well-structured

**Missing Tests:**

1. **Component Tests** (Required per Story)
   - ❌ `FabricAllocationCalculator.test.tsx` - Missing
   - ❌ `ProductionSchedulePlanner.test.tsx` - Missing
   - ❌ `DesignSuggestionTool.test.tsx` - Missing
   - ❌ `BulkProgressUpdater.test.tsx` - Missing
   - ❌ `GroupOrderMessaging.test.tsx` - Missing
   - ❌ `CoordinationChecklist.test.tsx` - Missing

2. **API Route Tests** (Required per Story)
   - ❌ API tests for all 8 endpoints - Missing
   - Story specifically mentions "Add comprehensive API tests and integration tests"

3. **Integration Tests** (Required per Story)
   - ❌ Complete tailor coordination workflow test - Missing
   - ❌ Bulk progress update transaction integrity test - Missing

4. **Specific Test Requirements Not Met:**
   - ❌ Fabric allocation calculation accuracy validation
   - ❌ Production schedule conflict detection testing
   - ❌ Design suggestion storage and retrieval tests
   - ❌ Coordination checklist completion workflow tests
   - ❌ Mobile responsive design validation
   - ❌ Accessibility compliance testing

**Coverage Target:** Story requires 60% statement coverage minimum - **Current coverage unknown but likely far below target**

### Security Review

**Status: PASS with Notes**

**Strengths:**
- ✓ Authentication and authorization checks in all API routes
- ✓ Role-based access control enforced (tailor role verification)
- ✓ Proper verification that tailor owns group order before mutations
- ✓ SQL injection protection via Supabase client (parameterized queries)

**Concerns:**
- ⚠️ No rate limiting implemented on bulk update operations (mentioned in Dev Notes but not implemented)
- ⚠️ No input validation schemas - request bodies are not validated before processing
- ⚠️ Audit logging mentioned in Dev Notes but not visible in implementation
- ⚠️ Image upload security (file type validation, size limits) not implemented yet

**Recommendations:**
- Implement Zod schema validation for all API request bodies
- Add rate limiting middleware for bulk operations and messaging
- Implement audit logging for sensitive operations (bulk updates, design approvals)
- Add file upload security when implementing image uploads

### Performance Considerations

**Strengths:**
- ✓ `useMemo` hooks used appropriately for expensive calculations
- ✓ Pagination mentioned in Dev Notes (though not visible in current implementation)
- ✓ Efficient filtering and sorting in dashboard component
- ✓ Proper async/await patterns throughout

**Concerns:**
- ⚠️ No lazy loading implemented for large group order lists (mentioned in Dev Notes)
- ⚠️ No debouncing on search inputs (could cause excessive re-renders)
- ⚠️ Promise.all() used in API routes without concurrency limits (could overwhelm database)
- ⚠️ No caching strategy for group order data
- ⚠️ No image optimization mentioned for uploaded photos

**Recommendations:**
- Implement debouncing on search inputs (300ms delay)
- Add virtual scrolling for large item lists in bulk updater
- Implement batch processing with limits for bulk operations
- Add React Query or SWR for data caching and revalidation
- Implement image compression before upload to reduce bandwidth

### Architecture & Design Patterns Assessment

**Overall: Good with Room for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
- ✓ Components follow single responsibility principle well
- ✓ Props interfaces are well-defined and documented
- ✓ Consistent error and loading state patterns
- ✓ Good separation between presentation and data fetching (hooks pattern)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Custom hooks (`useTailorGroupOrders`, etc.) are well-designed but underutilized - pages are fetching data directly
- Service layer mentioned in Dev Notes would improve testability but is missing
- Repository pattern specified in Dev Notes would centralize data access but is absent
- Form state management is scattered - consider using `react-hook-form` for consistency
- No centralized state management (Zustand mentioned in Dev Notes but not implemented)

### Documentation and Comments

**Status: Good**

**Strengths:**
- ✓ All components have JSDoc comments with descriptions
- ✓ Complex functions have explanatory comments
- ✓ Prop interfaces are well-documented
- ✓ README-style component headers explain purpose

**Minor Improvements:**
- Add examples in JSDoc for complex prop types
- Document API response structures in API route files
- Add troubleshooting section in component comments for common issues

### Final Status

**✗ Changes Required - Return to Development**

While the core UI implementation demonstrates good code quality and architectural thinking, **several critical features are incomplete or missing**, preventing this story from being marked as complete:

1. **Missing Critical Functionality**: Image uploads, WhatsApp integration, and notification services are placeholder code only
2. **Incomplete Test Coverage**: Only 1 of 7+ required test files exists, far below the 60% coverage minimum
3. **Missing Backend Components**: Services, repositories, and 50% of API routes are absent
4. **Missing Page Routes**: 3 of 4 page routes not implemented

**Estimated Completion**: Approximately **3-4 additional development days** required to complete missing functionality and testing.

**Developer Action Required**: Address all items in the "Critical - Must Complete Before Approval" section before resubmitting for QA review.

### Recommendations for Developer

1. **Prioritize Test Coverage First**: Write tests for existing components before implementing remaining features - this ensures quality and prevents regressions
2. **Complete Image Upload Next**: This affects 3 different acceptance criteria and is a blocker for several workflows
3. **Implement WhatsApp Integration**: This is a complete acceptance criteria (#6) that is currently non-functional
4. **Create Missing API Routes**: Several endpoints are specified but not implemented
5. **Add Missing Page Routes**: Complete the page routing structure as specified in Dev Notes

**Developer Strengths to Leverage:**
- Your component design is excellent - apply this same quality to the missing pieces
- Your TypeScript typing is thorough - maintain this standard throughout
- Your Ghana cultural integration is thoughtful - extend this attention to detail to all features

### Learning Points

For future stories, ensure that "completion" means **fully functional features**, not placeholder implementations. When marking tasks complete, verify that:
- All interactive elements have working functionality
- API integrations are connected, not stubbed
- Test files exist and pass for each component
- File list includes all items mentioned in Dev Notes

The work completed represents a solid foundation, but requires significant additional effort to meet production-ready standards.
