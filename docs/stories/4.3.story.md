### Recommendation Algorithm Logic

**Analytics Collection**:
- Track every completed order
- Extract: garment type, fabric, color, tailor, price point, season
- Calculate frequencies and patterns
- Update `order_analytics` table after each order

**Recommendation Types**:

1. **Garment Recommendations**:
   - "You might also like..." based on past garment types
   - Seasonal suggestions (e.g., "Traditional wear for upcoming festival season")
   - Occasion-based (extracted from order history patterns)

2. **Tailor Recommendations**:
   - "Try these tailors who specialize in [your preferred style]"
   - Tailors with similar portfolios to favorites
   - Highly-rated tailors in preferred price range

3. **Fabric Recommendations**:
   - "Customers who ordered [X] also chose these fabrics"
   - Seasonal fabric suggestions
   - New arrivals matching color preferences

**Scoring Algorithm**:
```typescript
// Implementation guideline for dev agent - create helper functions as needed
function calculateRecommendationScore(
  item: Order | Tailor | Fabric,
  analytics: OrderAnalytics
): number {
  let score = 0;

  // Type match (40%)
  // Dev Agent: Implement helper to check if item matches user's most frequent garment types
  if (matchesPreferredType(item, analytics.garmentTypeFrequency)) {
    score += 40;
  }

  // Fabric/color match (30%)
  // Dev Agent: Implement helper to check if item matches fabric/color preferences
  if (matchesPreferences(item, analytics.fabricPreferences, analytics.colorPreferences)) {
    score += 30;
  }

  // Price range match (20%)
  // Dev Agent: Implement helper to check if item price is within ±20% of average order value
  if (withinPriceRange(item, analytics.avgOrderValue)) {
    score += 20;
  }

  // Seasonal relevance (10%)
  // Dev Agent: Implement helper to check if item matches current season patterns
  if (matchesSeason(item, analytics.seasonalPatterns)) {
    score += 10;
  }

  return score;
}
```

### Loyalty Points Calculation

**Earning Points**:
- **Base**: 1 point per GHS spent on completed orders
- **Repeat Tailor Bonus**: +10% points when ordering from same tailor within 30 days
- **Milestone Bonuses**:
  - 5th order: +500 bonus points
  - 10th order: +1000 bonus points
  - 20th order: +2500 bonus points
- **Group Order Bonus**: +5% points for organizing family group orders
- **Referral Bonus**: +250 points per successful referral

**Tier System**:
- **Bronze**: 0-999 points (default)
- **Silver**: 1,000-4,999 points (5% bonus on all points earned)
- **Gold**: 5,000-14,999 points (10% bonus + priority customer support)
- **Platinum**: 15,000+ points (15% bonus + priority service + exclusive tailors)

**Redemption**:
- **10% Discount**: 500 points
- **15% Discount**: 750 points
- **20% Discount**: 1,000 points
- **Free Delivery**: 300 points
- **Priority Service**: 400 points (fast-track order)
- **Exclusive Tailor Access**: 1,500 points (access to premium tailors)

**Points Expiry**:
- Points expire 12 months after the LAST POINTS TRANSACTION (earn, redeem, or bonus award)
- Warning notification sent 30 days before expiry via WhatsApp
- Tier status maintained for 6 months after dropping below threshold
- Any new points transaction resets the 12-month expiry clock for ALL points

### WhatsApp Integration for Loyalty

**Notification Templates** (using existing WhatsApp service):

1. **Points Earned**:
   ```
   🎉 You've earned {points} loyalty points!
   Order #{orderNumber} - {garmentType}
   Total Points: {totalPoints}
   View rewards: {rewardsUrl}
   ```

2. **Tier Upgrade**:
   ```
   🏆 Congratulations! You've reached {tier} tier!
   New benefits unlocked:
   - {benefit1}
   - {benefit2}
   Explore perks: {loyaltyUrl}
   ```

3. **Reward Available**:
   ```
   💎 You can now redeem a {rewardName}!
   Points Required: {pointsCost}
   Your Points: {availablePoints}
   Redeem now: {redeemUrl}
   ```

4. **Points Expiry Warning**:
   ```
   ⚠️ {expiringPoints} points expiring in 30 days
   Use them before {expiryDate}
   Shop now: {shopUrl}
   ```

### Mobile-First Design Considerations

**Ghana Mobile Optimization** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Touch-friendly reorder buttons (min 44px tap target)
- Swipe gestures for favorites actions
- Progressive loading for recommendations
- Offline caching for favorites list
- Low-bandwidth mode for loyalty dashboard
- Quick actions for frequent operations

**Connectivity Optimization**:
- Cache recommendations locally (24-hour TTL)
- Queue favorite actions for offline sync
- Optimistic UI for all user actions
- Show stale data with refresh indicator
- Compress analytics data before sync

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

**Test File Locations**:
- Unit tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/components/features/{orders|favorites|loyalty}/`
- API tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/api/{reorder|favorites|loyalty}.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `apps/web/tests/integration/reorder-workflow/`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/reorder-favorites.spec.ts`

**Testing Frameworks** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Vitest for unit tests with 60% statement coverage minimum
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Playwright for E2E tests

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story**:
- Reorder workflow with tailor availability checks
- Favorites CRUD operations with family sharing
- Recommendation algorithm accuracy validation
- Loyalty points calculation and tier progression
- Points redemption with discount application
- Analytics data collection and aggregation
- WhatsApp notification delivery for loyalty events
- Mobile responsive design validation
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance testing for recommendation queries
- Error handling for all edge cases

### Performance Considerations

**Caching Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md - Vercel KV]:
- Cache recommendations in Redis/Vercel KV (1-hour TTL)
- Cache user analytics (30-minute TTL, invalidate on new order)
- Cache loyalty rewards catalog (24-hour TTL)
- Cache user loyalty account (5-minute TTL, invalidate on transaction)

**Database Performance**:
- Index `favorite_orders` on user_id for fast retrieval
- Index `loyalty_transactions` on user_id and created_at for history queries
- Index `order_analytics` on last_updated for stale data detection
- Use materialized view for recommendation pre-computation (nightly refresh)

**Frontend Performance**:
- Lazy load recommendations below the fold
- Virtual scrolling for long favorites lists
- Debounced search for favorites filtering
- Optimized images for favorite garment thumbnails
- Pagination for loyalty transaction history

### Security & Privacy

**Data Privacy**:
- User order history only accessible to user (RLS policy)
- Shared favorites visible only to specified family members
- Loyalty points non-transferable
- Analytics aggregated without PII

**Permission System** [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Customer role required for all endpoints
- Order ownership verified before reorder
- Favorite sharing validated against family measurement profiles
- Loyalty redemption requires active account

### Error Handling

**Reorder Errors**:
- Tailor unavailable → Suggest alternative tailors with similar style
- Fabric out of stock → Recommend similar fabrics
- Price changed → Show new pricing with explanation
- Measurement profile deleted → Prompt to recreate or use different profile

**Favorites Errors**:
- Order not found → Show error, refresh favorites list
- Already favorited → Update nickname instead
- Sharing permission denied → Explain family member must accept share
- Storage limit reached → Prompt to remove old favorites (max 50)

**Loyalty Errors**:
- Insufficient points → Show points needed, suggest ways to earn
- Reward inactive → Suggest alternative rewards
- Redemption failed → Retry with exponential backoff
- Account locked → Contact support message

**Analytics Errors**:
- Stale data → Use cached recommendations, refresh in background
- Computation timeout → Fall back to popular items recommendations
- No order history → Show curated starter recommendations

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-11

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade: B+ (Good Implementation with Testing Gaps)**

The implementation demonstrates solid architecture with proper separation of concerns through repository and service layers. All 7 acceptance criteria have corresponding implementation components (repositories, services, API routes, hooks, and UI components). The database schema is well-designed with appropriate RLS policies, triggers, and indexes.

**Strengths:**
- Clean repository pattern with proper data access abstraction
- Well-structured service layer with comprehensive business logic
- Proper use of React Query for client-side data management
- Good TypeScript typing throughout with shared types in packages/shared
- Database migration includes proper RLS policies and automated triggers
- API routes follow Next.js 14 App Router patterns correctly
- UI components use shadcn/ui consistently with Ghana color theming

**Weaknesses:**
- **Critical**: Minimal test coverage (only 2 test files for favorites, 0 for loyalty/reorder/recommendations)
- Missing integration tests for complete workflows
- No E2E tests for user journeys
- Some services lack proper error boundaries
- Missing WhatsApp notification integration mentioned in story
- No performance testing for recommendation algorithm

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review. The code structure is sound and follows project conventions. However, recommendations for improvement are listed below.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Pass (with minor notes)
  - JSDoc comments present but could be more comprehensive
  - Service naming conventions followed correctly
  - Repository pattern consistently applied
  - Note: Two favorites services exist (favorites.service.ts for tailors, favorite-orders.service.ts for orders) - this is intentional and properly documented

- **Project Structure**: ✓ Pass
  - Files correctly placed according to unified project structure
  - Proper workspace dependency usage (`@sew4mi/shared`)
  - API routes follow Next.js App Router structure

- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ Fail
  - Only 2/4 major features have unit tests
  - Test coverage well below 60% statement coverage requirement
  - No integration tests for multi-step workflows
  - No E2E tests for user journeys
  - Missing test files for: loyalty.service, reorder.service, recommendation-engine.service, all API routes, all React hooks, all UI components

- **All ACs Met**: ✓ Pass (Implementation Complete)
  - AC1-3 (Reorder): ReorderButton, ReorderWizard, API endpoints implemented
  - AC4,7 (Favorites): Complete system with sharing implemented
  - AC5 (Recommendations): Engine and scoring algorithm implemented
  - AC6 (Loyalty): Full points system with tiers and redemption
  - All database tables, services, repositories, hooks, and components present

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical (Must Address Before Production):**
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for loyalty.service.ts (points calculation, tier progression, redemption logic)
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for reorder.service.ts (order cloning, tailor availability)
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for recommendation-engine.service.ts (scoring algorithm validation)
- [ ] Add API route tests for all 13 endpoints (at minimum: loyalty/redeem, orders/reorder)
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete reorder workflow (select order → modify → create)
- [ ] Add integration tests for loyalty points lifecycle (earn → tier upgrade → redeem)
- [ ] Add E2E test for reorder happy path (Playwright)
- [ ] Add E2E test for loyalty redemption flow (Playwright)

**High Priority:**
- [ ] Implement WhatsApp notifications for loyalty milestones (mentioned in story but not implemented)
- [ ] Add error boundary components for graceful failure handling
- [ ] Add loading states and skeleton screens for all data fetching components
- [ ] Implement analytics tracking for recommendation engagement
- [ ] Add validation for MAX_FAVORITES limit (currently defined but not enforced in UI)
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints (especially loyalty/redeem)

**Medium Priority:**
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all public service methods with examples
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for recommendation algorithm queries
- [ ] Implement caching strategy for recommendations (Redis/Vercel KV mentioned but not implemented)
- [ ] Add optimistic UI updates for favorites operations
- [ ] Consider extracting loyalty calculation logic to separate utility class for better testability
- [ ] Add input sanitization for user-provided nicknames in favorites

**Low Priority (Technical Debt):**
- [ ] Consider moving loyalty constants to environment config for easier adjustment
- [ ] Add data migration scripts for existing users to create loyalty accounts
- [ ] Document API endpoints in OpenAPI/Swagger format
- [ ] Add telemetry for tracking feature adoption rates

### Security Review

**Status: PASS with Concerns**

**Strengths:**
- RLS policies properly configured for all tables
- Auth checks present in all API routes using Supabase server client
- User ownership validation before operations
- No direct database access from client components

**Concerns:**
- Missing rate limiting on redemption endpoint (could be abused)
- No input validation middleware for API routes
- Loyalty transactions table allows service-side inserts without user-level policy (by design, but monitor)
- No webhook signature validation mentioned for external integrations
- Missing CSRF protection for state-changing operations

**Recommendation:** Add rate limiting and input validation before production deployment.
