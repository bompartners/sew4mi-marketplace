## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase 15+ - Primary data store with ACID compliance for payments, complex relationships, PostGIS for location
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth - Built-in MFA, social logins, phone auth for Ghana market
- **File Storage:** Supabase Storage - Integrated with auth, CDN distribution, automatic image optimization

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
The complete database schema must include:

**Core Tables:**
- `users` - Core user entity with Ghana phone validation (+233 format)
- `tailor_profiles` - Extended profiles for verified expert tailors with PostGIS location
- `measurement_profiles` - Saved measurement sets with JSONB flexible structure
- `orders` - Core transaction entity with escrow payment tracking
- `order_milestones` - Progress tracking with photo verification
- `payment_transactions` - Complete audit trail for escrow system
- `group_orders` - Family/group order coordination
- `reviews` - Customer feedback and ratings
- `disputes` - Conflict resolution tracking

**Required Enums:**
- `user_role` - CUSTOMER, TAILOR, ADMIN
- `verification_status` - PENDING, VERIFIED, SUSPENDED
- `order_status` - Complete order lifecycle states
- `escrow_stage` - DEPOSIT, FITTING, FINAL, RELEASED
- `transaction_type` - DEPOSIT, FITTING_PAYMENT, FINAL_PAYMENT, REFUND
- `payment_provider` - MTN_MOMO, VODAFONE_CASH

### Data Models and Relationships
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
Key model relationships to implement:
- User has many MeasurementProfiles, has one TailorProfile (if TAILOR role)
- TailorProfile belongs to User, has many Orders, has many Reviews
- Order belongs to User (customer), belongs to TailorProfile, uses MeasurementProfile
- Order has many OrderMilestones, has many PaymentTransactions
- GroupOrder has many Orders, belongs to User (organizer)

### Project Structure Context
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Database-related files should be placed in:
- Database types: `packages/shared/src/types/database.ts`
- Supabase configuration: `apps/web/lib/supabase/`
- Migration files: `supabase/migrations/`
- Seeding scripts: `scripts/seed-db.ts`

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Critical rules for database work:
- **Type Sharing:** All database types in `packages/shared/src/types`
- **Database Access:** Repository pattern only - never call Supabase client directly from API routes
- **Environment Variables:** Access only through config objects, never `process.env` directly

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Users can only access their own data unless admin
- Customers can view verified tailors only
- Order participants (customer/tailor) can access order data
- Payment transactions visible to order participants only
- Admin role has full access to all data

### File Locations for New Code
- Supabase client setup: `apps/web/lib/supabase/client.ts` and `apps/web/lib/supabase/server.ts`
- Database types: `packages/shared/src/types/database.ts`
- Migration files: `supabase/migrations/20240811120000_initial_schema.sql` (using YYYYMMDDHHMMSS naming)
- Environment validation: Update `scripts/check-env.js` with Supabase variables
- Repository pattern: `apps/web/lib/repositories/` with base interface in `packages/shared/src/types/repository.ts`
- Repository implementations: `apps/web/lib/repositories/{entity}Repository.ts`

### Environment Variables Required
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key for client-side
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key for server-side operations
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string for direct access

### Connection and Performance Configuration
- Set up connection pooling for production workloads
- Configure read replicas for analytics queries (separate from transactional)
- Implement proper indexing strategy for Ghana-specific queries (location-based search)
- Enable PostGIS extension for tailor location features

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests for database operations: `apps/web/tests/unit/lib/repositories/`

**Testing Frameworks:**

- Schema validation: Zod schema testing with sample data

**Test Patterns:**
- Mock Supabase client for unit tests using Vitest mocks
- Use test database for integration tests with proper cleanup
- Test RLS policies with different user contexts
- Validate TypeScript type generation accuracy

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Test Ghana phone number validation (+233 format)
- Test PostGIS location queries for tailor search
- Verify RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access
- Test escrow amount calculations and constraints
- Validate JSONB measurement profile flexibility

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-11

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The Supabase integration and database schema implementation is comprehensive and well-structured. The developer has created a solid foundation for the application's data layer with proper database design, security measures, and TypeScript integration. The repository pattern implementation provides good abstraction and follows solid architectural principles.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/web/lib/repositories/measurementRepository.ts
  - **Change**: Removed unused `MeasurementProfileUpdate` type import and fixed async function return type
  - **Why**: TypeScript compilation was failing due to unused imports and incorrect return type annotation
  - **How**: Cleaned up unused imports and properly typed async functions to return Promise<T>

- **File**: apps/web/lib/repositories/orderRepository.ts
  - **Change**: Removed unused `OrderInsert` type import
  - **Why**: TypeScript compilation was failing due to unused import
  - **How**: Kept only the types that are actually used in the implementation

- **File**: apps/web/lib/repositories/tailorRepository.ts
  - **Change**: Removed unused `TailorProfileInsert` type import
  - **Why**: TypeScript compilation was failing due to unused import
  - **How**: Cleaned up type imports to include only necessary ones

- **File**: apps/web/lib/repositories/userRepository.ts
  - **Change**: Removed unused `UserInsert` type import
  - **Why**: TypeScript compilation was failing due to unused import
  - **How**: Simplified type imports to reduce noise and improve maintainability

- **File**: apps/web/lib/supabase/client.ts
  - **Change**: Updated Supabase client creation to use correct API for v2
  - **Why**: Original implementation used incorrect imports that don't exist in Supabase v2
  - **How**: Used standard `createClient` function with proper configuration options

- **File**: apps/web/lib/supabase/server.ts
  - **Change**: Simplified server client creation and removed unused imports
  - **Why**: Original implementation was overly complex and used non-existent APIs
  - **How**: Streamlined to use standard `createClient` approach that works with the installed Supabase version
