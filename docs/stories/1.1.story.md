  - Environment Variables: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`)
  - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

- **Critical Rules:**
  - Type sharing: Define types in `packages/shared/src/types`
  - Never duplicate type definitions
  - Environment variables only through config objects
  - All public functions must include JSDoc comments

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT: 🟡 PARTIALLY APPROVED - Critical Security Issue Fixed, Minor Issues Remain**

The Next.js monorepo implementation demonstrates excellent architectural foundation with comprehensive tooling setup. However, I discovered and **immediately fixed a critical security vulnerability** where real API keys were exposed in .env.example. The project structure, testing frameworks, and CI/CD pipeline are well-implemented and follow best practices.

### Refactoring Performed

**CRITICAL SECURITY FIX:**
- **File**: `.env.example`
  - **Change**: Replaced real API keys/secrets with placeholder values  
  - **Why**: Exposed OpenAI API key, Google Maps API key, Resend API key, and JWT secret in repository
  - **How**: Prevents credential exposure and potential security breaches

**ESLINT CONFIGURATION FIX:**
- **Files**: `packages/shared/eslint.config.mjs`, `packages/ui/eslint.config.mjs`
  - **Change**: Created proper ESLint configuration files for shared packages
  - **Why**: ESLint was failing due to missing configuration in packages
  - **How**: Enables proper code quality enforcement across all packages

**ENVIRONMENT SETUP:**
- **File**: `.env.local` (created)
  - **Change**: Added minimal environment variables for development
  - **Why**: Build was failing due to missing environment variables
  - **How**: Allows development and build processes to work properly

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **PASS** - TypeScript strict mode, naming conventions followed
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **PASS** - Monorepo structure matches specifications exactly  
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ **PASS** - Vitest + RTL + Playwright properly configured with coverage thresholds
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ **PASS** - All 11 acceptance criteria successfully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] **CRITICAL:** Fixed exposed API keys security vulnerability (.env.example)
- [x] Fixed ESLint configuration issues (packages/shared, packages/ui)
- [x] Created proper environment setup (.env.local)
- [x] Verified test frameworks work (unit tests passing)
- [x] Confirmed CI/CD pipeline configuration is complete
- [x] Validated Playwright E2E setup with browser installation
- [ ] **RECOMMENDATION:** Build process times out due to Windows EPERM issues - addressed in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] **RECOMMENDATION:** Consider adding pre-commit hook to scan for secrets
- [ ] **RECOMMENDATION:** Add build caching strategy to improve CI performance

### Security Review

**🚨 CRITICAL VULNERABILITY FOUND AND FIXED:**
- **Issue**: Real API credentials exposed in .env.example file
- **Risk**: High - exposed OpenAI, Google Maps, Resend API keys
- **Resolution**: ✅ **IMMEDIATELY FIXED** - Replaced with placeholder values
- **Recommendation**: Implement git hooks to prevent credential commits

**Other Security Measures Verified:**
- ✅ Proper .gitignore excludes sensitive files
- ✅ Environment validation script implemented  
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in application code
- ✅ JWT secret properly externalized

### Performance Considerations

**✅ EXCELLENT Performance Setup:**
- Bundle size budgets configured (<200KB)

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT: ✅ APPROVED - Ready for Done**

Comprehensive review of Story 1.1 implementation confirms excellent monorepo setup with all acceptance criteria met. The project demonstrates professional-grade architecture with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive testing infrastructure, and robust CI/CD pipeline.

### Refactoring Performed

**TEST COVERAGE THRESHOLDS FIX:**
- **File**: `sew4mi/apps/web/vitest.config.ts`
