- Commission deducted from each milestone payment release
- Use established `PaymentService` class for payment processing integration

**Commission Calculation Logic**:
```typescript
// Example calculation for milestone payment
const milestonePayment = orderTotal * milestonePercentage; // e.g., 50% fitting payment
const commissionAmount = milestonePayment * 0.20; // 20% platform fee
const tailorPayment = milestonePayment - commissionAmount;
```

### Payment History Integration
