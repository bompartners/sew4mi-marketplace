  - **How**: Improves maintainability by consolidating validation logic in one location, reduces code duplication

- **File**: `sew4mi/packages/shared/src/constants/payment.ts`
  - **Change**: Corrected Ghana phone prefixes from 3-digit to 2-digit format
  - **Why**: Ghana phone numbers use 2-digit network prefixes (24, 54, etc.) not 3-digit (024, 054, etc.)
  - **How**: Ensures accurate phone number validation and network detection

- **File**: `sew4mi/packages/shared/src/utils/phone-validation.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed prefix extraction logic to use 2-digit prefixes
  - **Why**: Match actual Ghana phone number format specifications
  - **How**: Corrected substring extraction from position 3-5 instead of 3-6

- **File**: `sew4mi/apps/web/tests/unit/utils/phone-validation.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Updated test expectations to match corrected 2-digit prefix format
  - **Why**: Tests must align with corrected implementation
  - **How**: Ensures test coverage validates the correct behavior

- **File**: `sew4mi/apps/web/tests/unit/lib/services/hubtel.service.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Updated imports to use shared phone validation utility
