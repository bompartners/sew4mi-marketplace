# Sew4Mi Marketplace Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Transform custom clothing from a risky gamble into a reliable service for Ghana's 400,000+ professionals and event-goers
- Achieve 2,000 successful custom clothing orders in Year 1 with 80% on-time delivery rate, with 60% coordinated through WhatsApp
- Build a network of 20 verified expert tailors providing income improvement and business growth support
- Generate ₵1,200,000 gross revenue while reaching break-even by month 9, enhanced by WhatsApp family coordination driving 25% higher order frequency
- Establish market leadership in Ghana's custom clothing marketplace with 50% customer referral rate (enhanced by WhatsApp family network effects)
- Achieve 70% WhatsApp adoption rate with 40% of customers using voice measurement collection within first 6 months

### Background Context

Ghana's tailoring heritage represents centuries of exceptional craftsmanship, yet 70% of custom clothing orders currently fail due to late delivery, poor fit, or payment disputes. This represents ₵500M in annual value destruction and prevents customers from accessing the superior fit and cultural authenticity that custom clothing provides.

The Sew4Mi marketplace addresses this challenge by building trust-first infrastructure that preserves the personal relationships and cultural expertise of traditional tailoring while adding payment protection, reliable delivery dates, and quality verification. Our progressive escrow system (25%-50%-25% payments), expert tailor verification process, and delivery reliability system transform custom clothing into a dependable service for emerging professionals building career wardrobes.

Enhanced with deep WhatsApp integration, Sew4Mi makes trusted custom tailoring accessible through Ghana's most familiar communication platform, enabling voice-based measurements in local languages, family coordination for group orders, and conversational order creation while maintaining all quality and payment protection standards.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a trust-building, mobile-first experience that feels as personal as visiting your neighborhood tailor while providing the reliability of modern e-commerce. The interface should celebrate Ghanaian cultural aesthetics while maintaining simplicity for users with varying digital literacy levels.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Start simple with core actions, reveal advanced features as users gain confidence
- **Visual Progress Tracking:** Photo-based journey from fabric to finished garment builds transparency and excitement
- **WhatsApp-Native Communication:** Leverage familiar messaging patterns for notifications and support
- **Family-Centric Design:** Easy switching between family member profiles with visual avatars
- **Offline-First Resilience:** Core functions work despite intermittent connectivity

### Core Screens and Views
- **Tailor Discovery Screen:** Browse expert tailors with portfolios, specializations, and ratings

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The platform will meet WCAG AA standards to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities, including proper color contrast, screen reader support, and keyboard navigation.

### Branding
Modern African aesthetic combining traditional Kente patterns as subtle design elements with clean, professional typography. Color palette should evoke trust (blue), craftsmanship (gold accents), and Ghana heritage (red/green/yellow used sparingly). Photography should showcase real Ghanaian professionals in authentic work and social settings.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Mobile-first responsive web application optimized for smartphones (85% of users), with functional desktop experience for admin users and corporate partnerships. Progressive Web App architecture enables app-like experience without app store friction.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Initial development will use a monorepo structure for faster iteration and shared code reuse. This allows the frontend, backend API, admin dashboard, and infrastructure code to be managed together with consistent tooling and deployment pipelines.

### Service Architecture
**Microservices within Monorepo** - While maintaining a monorepo structure, the application will be architected as loosely coupled services: Core Marketplace Service, Payment Processing Service, Communication Service (WhatsApp/SMS), and Admin Service. Next.js API routes and Edge Functions provide serverless scalability.

### Testing Requirements
**Full Testing Pyramid** - Given the financial transactions and trust-critical nature of the platform, comprehensive testing is required:
- Unit tests for all business logic (minimum 80% coverage)
- Integration tests for Hubtel payment APIs and WhatsApp messaging
- E2E tests for critical user journeys (order placement, payment flow)
- Manual testing convenience methods for QA in Ghana's variable network conditions

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Backend Framework:** Next.js API routes with Edge Functions for serverless scalability
- **Database & Auth:** Supabase providing PostgreSQL database, real-time subscriptions, and authentication
- **Cloud Provider:** Vercel for hosting with automatic scaling and global edge network
- **CDN:** Vercel's built-in edge network optimized for global content delivery
- **Payment Integration:** Hubtel API for unified payment processing (supports MTN Mobile Money, Vodafone Cash, AirtelTigo Money, Visa/Mastercard, and bank transfers)
- **Messaging:** WhatsApp Business Cloud API with advanced features (Interactive messages, catalogs, voice processing), SMS via Hubtel SMS API as fallback
- **File Storage:** Supabase Storage for photos and documents with CDN delivery
- **Real-time Features:** Supabase Realtime for order status updates and messaging
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with JWT tokens, social logins, and mobile OTP support
- **API Design:** Next.js API routes with tRPC for type-safe API calls
- **Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics and Supabase Dashboard for performance monitoring
- **Security:** Supabase Row Level Security (RLS), Vercel SSL certificates, API rate limiting
- **Mobile Strategy:** Progressive Web App (PWA) using Next.js PWA plugin
- **Offline Support:** Service workers with next-pwa for offline functionality
- **Image Optimization:** Vercel's built-in Next.js Image Optimization API
