## 🚫 Blocker #1: Dependency Security Vulnerabilities

### Status: ⚠️ **REQUIRES TEAM DECISION**

### Vulnerability Details

```json
{
  "critical": 1,
  "moderate": 6,
  "total": 7
}
```

#### CRITICAL (1 vulnerability)

**Package:** `happy-dom`  
**Current Version:** ^18.0.1  
**Fixed Version:** 20.0.2  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  

**CVEs:**
- **GHSA-37j7-fg3j-429f**: VM Context Escape leading to Remote Code Execution
- **GHSA-qpm2-6cq5-7pq5**: Insufficient code generation isolation

**Impact:** Test environment only (dev dependency)

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Option 1: Manual upgrade (recommended for control)
npm install --save-dev happy-dom@^20.0.2

# Option 2: Force auto-fix (may break tests)
npm audit fix --force
```

---

#### MODERATE (6 vulnerabilities)

**Package Chain:** `esbuild` → `vite` → `@vitest/mocker`, `vite-node`, `vitest` → `@vitest/coverage-v8`

**Current Versions:**
- `vitest`: ^2.1.8
- `@vitest/coverage-v8`: ^2.1.8

**Fixed Versions:**
- `vitest`: 3.2.4
- `@vitest/coverage-v8`: 3.2.4

**Severity:** MODERATE  

**CVEs:**
- **GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99**: esbuild allows websites to send requests to development server

**Impact:** Development/test environment only

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Upgrade vitest ecosystem (major version bump)
npm install --save-dev vitest@^3.2.4 @vitest/coverage-v8@^3.2.4

# OR use auto-fix
npm audit fix --force
```

---

### ✅ GOOD NEWS

- ✅ **NO production dependencies affected**
- ✅ **`bad-words@^3.0.4` is NOT vulnerable** (newly added for review moderation)
- ✅ **All fixes are straightforward upgrades**
- ✅ **All vulnerabilities have clear resolution paths**

---

### Recommended Resolution Path

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 30-60 minutes  
**Risk Level:** LOW (test dependencies only)

#### Step 1: Backup Current State
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: Before dependency security fixes"
```

#### Step 2: Upgrade Critical Package
```bash
cd sew4mi
npm install --save-dev happy-dom@^20.0.2
```

#### Step 3: Upgrade Vitest Ecosystem
```bash
npm install --save-dev vitest@^3.2.4 @vitest/coverage-v8@^3.2.4
```

#### Step 4: Verify No New Vulnerabilities
```bash
npm audit
```

#### Step 5: Run Tests (proceed to Blocker #2)
```bash
npm run test
```

#### Step 6: If Tests Fail Due to Breaking Changes
- Review vitest v3 migration guide: https://vitest.dev/guide/migration.html
- Update test configuration if needed
- Update test setup files if needed

---

## 🚫 Blocker #2: Test Environment Issues

### Status: 🔧 **PARTIALLY FIXED**

### What Was Fixed

✅ **Added Next.js `next/headers` mock** to `sew4mi/apps/web/tests/setup.ts`:
```typescript
vi.mock('next/headers', () => ({
  cookies: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve({
    getAll: vi.fn(() => []),
    get: vi.fn((name: string) => undefined),
    set: vi.fn(),
    delete: vi.fn(),
    has: vi.fn(() => false),
  })),
  headers: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve({
    get: vi.fn((name: string) => null),
    has: vi.fn(() => false),
    forEach: vi.fn(),
  })),
}));
```

---

### What Still Needs Fixing

#### Issue #1: Missing `.env.test` File

**File:** `sew4mi/apps/web/.env.test`  
**Status:** ❌ **DOES NOT EXIST**

The test setup tries to load this file but it's missing:
```typescript
// tests/setup.ts line 6
config({ path: path.resolve(__dirname, '../.env.test') });
```

**Resolution:** Create the file with mock environment variables:

```bash
# Create .env.test file
cat > sew4mi/apps/web/.env.test << 'EOF'
# Test Environment Variables
# These are mock values for testing - not real Supabase credentials

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=test-anon-key-for-testing-only
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=test-service-role-key-for-testing-only

# Node environment
NODE_ENV=test
EOF
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Add `.env.test` to `.gitignore` if it contains any real credentials (though it shouldn't).

---

#### Issue #2: Tests Still Failing

**Last Error Seen:**
```
This error originated in "tests/unit/api/admin/roles.test.ts" test file.
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. Missing environment variables (create `.env.test`)
2. Other Next.js modules need mocking
3. Review-specific tests need Supabase client properly mocked
4. Vitest version compatibility issues (upgrade per Blocker #1)

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Create `.env.test` file** (see above)

2. **Run tests again with verbose output:**
```bash
cd sew4mi
npm run test -- --reporter=verbose
```

3. **If review tests still fail, verify mock setup:**
   - Check `sew4mi/apps/web/tests/mocks/supabase.ts` is being used
   - Ensure test files properly inject mocked client
   - Review error messages for specific mock needs

4. **Run review tests specifically:**
```bash
cd sew4mi
npm run test -- tests/unit/lib/repositories/review.repository.test.ts
npm run test -- tests/unit/lib/services/review.service.test.ts
npm run test -- tests/integration/reviews/review-lifecycle.test.ts
```

---

### Recommended Resolution Path

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (requires debugging)

#### Step 1: Create `.env.test`
```bash
cd sew4mi/apps/web
# Create the file manually with the content shown above
```

#### Step 2: Upgrade Dependencies (if not done)
```bash
cd ../..  # back to sew4mi root
npm install --save-dev vitest@^3.2.4 @vitest/coverage-v8@^3.2.4 happy-dom@^20.0.2
```

#### Step 3: Run Full Test Suite
```bash
npm run test
```

#### Step 4: Debug Failing Tests
- Review error messages carefully
- Check which mocks are missing
- Add additional mocks to `tests/setup.ts` as needed

#### Step 5: Verify Review Tests Pass
```bash
# Run review tests specifically
npm run test -- --grep="review"
```

#### Step 6: Verify Coverage
```bash
npm run test:coverage
# Review coverage report, target >90% for review module
```
